## Auxo: Scalable and Efficient E-Commerce Platform (Spring & Spring Boot)

**Introducing Auxo,** a robust E-commerce platform architected with Spring and Spring Boot for exceptional scalability and maintainability. This solution empowers you to create a seamless shopping experience for your customers.

**Built with Microservices:**

Auxo leverages microservices, a modern approach for building complex applications. This ensures efficient handling of core functionalities through independent, modular services:

* **User Authentication Service (Spring Security, JWT):** Handles user registration, login, and authorization, providing a secure foundation for customer accounts.
* **Product Service (Spring Data JPA, Production-Grade Database):** Manages product information, including details, inventory, and images, keeping your product catalog organized and up-to-date.
* **Order Service (Spring Cloud Stream, Apache Kafka):** Processes order creation, payment integration, and order fulfillment, streamlining the purchase experience from checkout to delivery.

**Technology Stack:**

* **Spring:** The core framework for building enterprise-grade Java applications.
* **Spring Boot:** Simplifies application development with autoconfiguration and streamlined boilerplate code.
* **Spring Security:** Provides robust user authentication and authorization mechanisms.
* **Spring Data JPA:** Simplifies database interactions with a layered persistence approach.
* **Production-Grade Database (MySQL):** A powerful and reliable database to store and manage your e-commerce data.
* **Spring Cloud Stream:** Enables asynchronous messaging between microservices using Apache Kafka.
* **Apache Kafka:** A distributed streaming platform for handling high-volume data streams, crucial for order processing and communication between services.

**Getting Started**

**Prerequisites:**

* Java Development Kit (JDK) ([https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/))
* An IDE for Java development (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA) with Spring Tool Suite plugin ([https://spring.io/tools](https://spring.io/tools))

**Project Setup:**

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mustafa2611/E-Commerce-Project.git
   ```

2. **Set up database connection:**

   - Configure the database connection details in the appropriate configuration files.
   - Ensure you have a running database instance.

3. **Build and run the application:**

   - Follow the specific build instructions within the project. This might involve using Maven or Gradle.
   - Once built, run each microservice individually using its main class file.

**Further Considerations:**

* **Security:** Implement robust security measures throughout the application, including input validation, secure password hashing, and authorization checks.
* **Scalability:** The microservices architecture allows for horizontal scaling of individual services to handle increased traffic.
* **Testing:** Write unit and integration tests to ensure the functionality and coherence of your microservices.
